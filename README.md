### My project is a device that consists of a high accuracy I2C temperature sensor placed on a window or door near the entrance of your house. Another sensor, the ultrasonic sonar distance sensor detects when you are near the door, about to leave. The connected LCD screen displays the temperature outside. The information will also be sent to Adafruit IO feed. A reactive trigger will be created to send an email to the person when Adafruit IO feed receives a value equal to or less than 1 meter from the distance sensor. The email will contain the temperature reading from the temperature sensor and tell the user he or she should wear a coat if the temperature is less than 10Â°C.
